# --Crop-Recommendation--
Developed a ML model that helps predict the most suitable crop by analysing the various parameters of soil. 
A predictive model is built using the given datatset to recommend the most suitable crops to grow in a particular farm based on various parameters.

# The various parameters taken into consideration are:

N - ratio of Nitrogen content in soil , 
P - ratio of Phosphorous content in soil ,
K - ratio of Potassium content in soil ,
Temperature - temperature in degree Celsius ,
humidity - relative humidity in % ,
pH - pH value of the soil ,
Rainfall - rainfall in mm
